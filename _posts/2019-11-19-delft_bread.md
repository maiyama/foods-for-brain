### Exploring the city of Delft in Netherlands

Back in June 2019, I had an opportunity to visit the Hague for a conference and explore a few nearby cities in the Netherlands. Luckily, my colleague and I met a local student who was doing his Ph.D. in Delft and got to hang out in this small, quiet and beautiful city with his guide. 

#### Little facts about Delft
