今年の６月、オランダのハーグで学会があった際に周辺都市を巡る機会がありました。
幸いにも、学会で、デルフト（Delft）という都市の大学院に所属している子に出会い、デルフトの案内をしてもらうことができました。アムステルダムやハーグに比べると小さいですが、とてもキレイで穏やかな街でした！今回のブログは、そこで古き良き風車について学んだり、地元のレストランに行った旅の記録になります。

#### デルフトとはどんな場所？

- 位置: ハーグの南 (だいたい電車で５０分くらい), 南オランダ地区に属する
- 人口: 101,400人 [ [1] ]
- デルフト陶器で知られる （白と青が伝統的に用いられる）[ [2] ]

### 毎週木曜日に挽かれる小麦粉 

デルフトに来るために乗った電車が通る線路のすぐ近くにある風車、"[Delftse Molen de Roos]"。今はオランダ国内でも数少ない、昔ながらの風車の一つ。 
現在は主にボランティアの人たちが案内や風車の運営をしているらしく、小麦粉を挽くのは毎週木曜日だけだそう。たまたまデルフトに行ったのが木曜日だったので、ガイドの人からいろいろ聞きながら小麦粉がどんどん出てくる様子を観ることができました！ 普通の小麦粉だけでなく、スペルト

According to the guide inside of the windmill:

> Windmills have played a major role in the Netherlands. 
Around 1200 the first windmills were probably built in our country. 
Initially they were only used to grind grain.
From the fifteenth century onward, they were also used to move water, which greatly increased the habitability of our country. In the seventeenth century, the first mills were used for industry. 
Mills were used for many purposes and in the eighteenth century some 10,000 mills were in operation. By 1900 there were still 4,000 mills in the Netherlands; by 1996 this number had shrunk to 1,000. [Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator]

So this windmill has been protected and maintained by the [Dutch Mill society] founded in 1923 and the local organization. The decline of the number of mills started at the beginning of the industrial revolution after the discovery of steam power. Before then, mills were used for all kinds of purposes, including grinding paint, oil, cocoa, grains and corns. 

There is a small gift shop in the base of the Delftse Molen de Roos where you can find all kinds of things to bake beautiful bread. I wanted to get so many things...bread recipe book in Dutch, proofing basket in different shapes... but I had a limited amount of luggage that I could fly with for free. I ended up getting just 1 kg of rye flour produced in the windmill and baked a loaf of sourdough bread with it at home!

### Stamppot: Dutch home-cooked meal that fills you up

Our guide took us to a small, cozy and friendly local restaurant, [THUIS by Ladera], for dinner. 
We went to the patio in the backside of the restaurant, filled with green plants and funky decorations. Some of us decided to order Stamppot, which is a large plate of mashed potato with some green leafy vegetables, topped with meat such as a sausage. In our case, we got a lot of bacon pieces and a large meatball. It was simple but very good. Such a nice way to finish off a sunny day with hearty Dutch food, Dutch beer (Hertog Jan) and a great company of friends!
